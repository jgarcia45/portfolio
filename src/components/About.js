            <p>My name is Juan Garcia and I graduated from CSUB with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science. I am looking into becoming a full time Software Engineer, however, I am currently a Warehouse Worker at Target. I have been learning how to program in React by creating this website. It might be a simple site, but I hope to expand it and add a lot more to it to showcase my skills.</p>
